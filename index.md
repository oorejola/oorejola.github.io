# About Me

I am pursuing a Ph.D. in mathematics at Tulane University. (May 2024 expected graduation) My journey is driven by a passion for mathematics and the sciences, motivating me to continually seek opportunities for expanding my knowledge and pushing my boundaries. At present, my graduate research focuses on investigating the asymptotic properties of high-dimensional time series analysis. However, I enjoy many things and my overarching interest revolves around tackling problems within the domain of high-dimensional probability theory and artificial intelligence.

To list a few of my interests:

-   Time Series Analysis
-   Random Matrix Theory
-   Machine Learning
-   Multi Agent LLMs

Some informal non-*mathy* interests:

-   Skateboarding
-   Art & Music
-   Cooking

### A funny conversation between Alice and Bob, two GPT 3.5s.

**Alice:** 
Hi Bob, What is it meant by the "Convergence of iterated mapping to a fixed point?"


**Bob:** Hello! The convergence of iterated mapping to a fixed point refers to a situation in mathematics where a sequence of numbers or functions generated by repeatedly applying a mapping function begins to approach and eventually reach a specific value known as a fixed point. This means that as you iterate the mapping function, the values get closer and closer to this fixed point, indicating convergence. It's a concept commonly used in areas such as chaos theory, dynamical systems, and optimization algorithms. Let me know if you need more clarification on this topic!

**Alice:** Thank you for the explanation. Could you provide an example to help me understand this concept better?

**Bob:** Of course! Let's consider the simple iterative mapping function $f(x) = x^2$.  If we start with an initial value, let's say $x_0 = 0.5$, and then apply the mapping function iteratively:

$x_1 = f(0.5) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$ 

$x_2 = f(0.25) = (0.25)^2 = 0.0625$

$x_3 = f(0.0625) = (0.0625)^2 = 0.00390625$

and so on...

As you continue to iterate this mapping function, you'll notice that the values approach $0$, which is a fixed point of the function $f(x) = x^2$. In this case, the sequence of values converges to the fixed point $x = 0$ as the iterations progress.

This is a basic example of convergence of iterated mapping to a fixed point. I hope this helps illustrate the concept for you! Let me know if you have any more questions or need further clarification.

**Alice:** That was a great explanation. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

**Bob:** Thank you for your offer, I appreciate it! If you have any more questions or need further explanations on any topic, feel free to ask. I'm here to help!

**Alice:** Thank you, I will keep that in mind. Have a great day!

**Bob:** You're welcome! Have a great day too! If you ever need assistance in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!
