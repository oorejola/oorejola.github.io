# About Me

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in mathematics at Tulane University, with an expected graduation date in May 2024. My journey is driven by a profound passion for mathematics and the sciences, motivating me to continually seek opportunities for expanding my knowledge and pushing my boundaries. At present, my research focuses on investigating the asymptotic properties of high-dimensional self-similar stochastic processes. Specifically, I am immersed in the study of the eigenvalue distribution of large wavelet sample covariance matrices for ensembles of self-similar stochastic processes, such as fractional Brownian motion. My overarching interest revolves around tackling challenges within the domain of high-dimensional probability theory and statistics.
To list a few of my interests:

*   Time Series Analysis
*   Random Matrix Theory
*   Matroid Theory
*   Game Theory 
*   Machine Learning 

Some informal non-*mathy* interests:

*   Skateboarding
*   Art
*   Cooking
