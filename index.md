# About Me

I'm currently a Ph.D at student studying mathematics at Tulane University. However, I like to consider myself a math enthusiast. When out of the office I enjoy long walks on the beach and relaxing with my cat, Mochi. My current research focuses on the asymptotic behavior of high-dimensional self-similar stochastic processes. In particular, I am investigating the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalue distribution of large wavelet sample covariance matrices for ensembles of fractional Brownian motion. A mouthful, being precise can be wordy. Overall, I'm attracted to problems that can be characterized in the context high-dimensional probability theory/statistics. 

To list a few of my interests:

*   Random Matrix Theory
*   Statistical (Machine) Learning 
*   Generative Models
*   Physics Informed Neural Networks

Some informal non-*mathy* interests:

*   Skateboarding
*   Music
*   Art
*   My cat, Mochi
